Notes:

The sprite stuff might be a bit difficult, perhaps remake the project as a Game instead (which probably makes more sense).

The Pet class is technically incomplete but one can initialize a Pet and have its stats set and everything already. Just need to figure out what other functionality we want to add to the Pet class.


TODO:

    Make the environment in which the pets will exist in

    Implement battle system

    Find out what we want to do for the evolutions and whether we still want them
