Notes:

DONE - The sprite stuff might be a bit difficult, perhaps remake the project as a Game instead (which probably makes more sense).

The Pet class is technically incomplete but one can initialize a Pet and have its stats set and everything already. Just need to figure out what other functionality we want to add to the Pet class.


TODO:

    Make the environment in which the pets will exist in

    Implement battle system

    Find out what we want to do for the evolutions and whether we still want them

    Generalize the animate function in GameViewController such that you can pass in the array of images
